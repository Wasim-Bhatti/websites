					<h2 class="font3"> Kendrick Lamar</h2>
					<h2 class="font2"> Music Blog #1</h2>

					</p> Kendrick fans have been waiting years for K-Dot to come through with something like this. Ever since good kid, m.A.A.d. city fans have waited for Kendrick to drop some cold bars with a west coast flavor. Since that album, Kendrick released two albums that have strayed a bit from his typical rap album. To Pimp a Butterfly was more of a soul/R&B with more of a hip-hop vibe, something that Kendrick hardly touched prior to To Pimp A Butterfly. To Pimp a Butterfly was also more conscious rap about ongoing political issues, a detour from the typical gang/ street raps that we saw on good kid, m.A.A.d. city. After that we were treated to untitled unmastered. That album
					was as the title suggests, released without audio mastering and no real overarching
					theme but was basically an extension of music that he never finished from around the same time as To Pimp a Butterfly and consists of the same genre bending hip-hop!

					<h2 class="font3"> Pink Floyd </h2>
					<h2 class="font2"> Music Blog #2</h2>

					</p> For many people, Pink Floyd as a meaningful combination of two words did not even properly exist before 1973, even though by that time the band had already gone through at least three different stages of evolution. Fellow musicians, critics, and all sorts of experienced music lovers knew very well about all these stages, and one should never confuse commercial and popular success with artistic peak; but even so, there is a very strong case to be made for the argument that all the first seven years of Floyd's musical journey were spent in an effort to find the best application for their talents, and that it was not until 1973 that the issue was resolved.</p>

					<h2 class="font3"> Daft Punk </h2>
					<h2 class="font2"> Music Blog #3</h2>

					</p> 
					A legendary group that came by storm in the early 90s from France, are now the founders of what today’s funk/electric music genre is. This super group made up of two men started their journey with a fresh look to music and how it could be done differently.

					I first listened to their album “Random Access Memories” back in 2013 when it first released and I was struck with a perfect album that had a perfect transition from each song and a purpose to its sound.

					Daft Punk seems to embracing the time period where they came from. Their “old school” sound sets them apart from other electric dance music artists. Their style stems from the new synths made popular in the 80s. Along with the sound of their music, Daft Punk creates timeless music for any generation to listen to and enjoy. The masks they wear provide the idea that the original producers may or may not be performing. This ambiguity allows for someone to listen to their music with a blind eye. It doesn’t matter what their appearance is as long as people listen to their music.

					The robot themed masks also parallel their music. They will always have their own genre and seem too electronic to be real. Daft Punk is an amazing duo and their music will resonate across the world forever.</p>
