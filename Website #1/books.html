					<h2 class="font3"> "One Up On Wall Street" - Peter Lynch</h2>
					<h2 class="font2"> Book Blog #1</h2>

					</p> Really great book on equity investing.

					Lynch takes a great deal of time persuading the reader that the average man on the street has an advantage over the Wall Street analysts tucked away in their ivory towers.

					He suggests playing to one’s strengths, using whatever specialist knowledge we have gathered to work out if a company is likely to see changes in earnings. Even our experiences as consumers can be quite telling, and may offer clues about the direction in which a company might be going.

					It’s a really refreshing take on investing in equities, there’s not a huge amount on formulae and statistical methods. The main focus is really on helping you set up the right mindset with which to invest.</p>

					<h2 class="font3"> "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People" - Stephen R. Covey</h2>
					<h2 class="font2"> Book Blog #2</h2>

					</p> Inspirational, developmental, and practical -- what a combination! The principles of behavior covered in this groundbreaking and long-respected book are of great worth to anyone seeking success in career, family, or any other aspect of their life. Covey discusses first the actions we must take (or habits we must develop) internally first - getting our heads and hearts right first. These include being proactive, beginning with the end in mind, and putting first things first. These constitute the "private victory." He then moves on to the "public victory," that is, the things that we can do that involve other people, and not just our own internal battles and development. These include, thinking win/win, seeking first to understand and then to be understood, and achieving synergy with others. Finally, he addresses the truth that we won't always be energetic and at our best in his discussion of personal renewal. Key to that is the idea of sharpening the saw...that is, we can only be at the top of our game for so long before we need to re-energize. Any serious athlete understands that principle.</p>

					<h2 class="font3"> "The Pocket Aristotle" - Justin D. Kaplan </h2>
					<h2 class="font2"> Book Blog #3</h2>

					</p> This is a selection of key moments in Aristotle. For the most part it is outstanding. I really enjoyed reading Aristotle. Following the arguments was sometimes exciting. I have some problems with the selection: Per Nichomachean ethics, the section on friendship could have been dropped and this would have allowed the editor to include the section on justice. It’s hard to imagine any social discourse today that doesn’t involve “justice.” But no matter.
